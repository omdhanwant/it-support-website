              <p>
                The healthcare environment is changing. The Affordable Care Act
                and the transition to ICD-10 put an added layer of expense and
                complexity on our already burdened system. Patient volumes are
                on the rise with the newly insured, and high-deductible plans
                are putting added pressure on revenue cycle operations and their
                drive to collect. The key to success is access to a large pool
                of qualified denial management resources that work in any
                Practice Management System and understand how to quickly and
                correctly analyze account history, appeal denied claims, and get
                timely turnaround to recover on and close out A/R. Analysts
                adept at trending denials and looking for patterns of deficiency
                will increase cash flow and reduce aging A/R.

                KBS provides access to a large and scalable pool of resources

                Credit Balance Resolution
              </h3>
              <p>
                This liability carries with it real and serious financial and
                compliance risk. It is your fiduciary responsibility to manage
                these real risks. Industry data shows that over 55% of credit
                balances are a result of incorrect posting of allowances.
              </p>
              <p>
                Federal Register published rules that went into effect in
                mid-March 2016 that:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Providers must repay Medicare overpayments within 60 days of
                  identifying the overpayment, although they can take up to six
                  months to investigate suspected overpayments.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Providers must repay identified overpayments occurring within
                  the past six years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Repayments can be made by refunds, claims adjustments, a
                  credit balance, or another appropriate process.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Penalties are stiff for noncompliance. Providers that do not
                report and repay the overpayments are subject to penalties under
                the False Claims Act and could be prohibited from participating
                in federal healthcare programs, according to CMS.
              </p>

                KBS has built strong working relationships with our clients to
                consistently meet their needs as credit balance backlogs are
                prioritized and processed. Incorrect adjustments, erroneous
                credits, and misuse of debit codes makes this credit balance
                task quite challenging, requiring precision, attention to
                detail, and a focus on operational excellence.
              </p>
              <p>
                KBS has maintained a team specialized in credit balances
                resolution since 2010. The team is comprised of highly-qualified
                individuals with a hospital accounting background and strong
                analytical skills. All KBS analysts are diligent and well
                trained to ensure outstanding credit balances are accurately
                resolved in an expeditious manner. We understand a professional
                and cooperative environment is the key to resolving more credit
                balances, many of which become ‘account corrections’ as opposed
                to actual ‘refunds’; hence, our operational model is highly
                client-centric.

                  Determine if double payments were made – if so, refund as

                <li>By patient and insurance carrier</li>
                <li>By two insurance carriers (both acting as Primary)</li>
