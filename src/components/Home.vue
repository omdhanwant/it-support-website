              Treating all stakeholders in the process as clients, internal or
              external, we have integrated real time metrics for workflow
              management, quality control, and reward management. At a time when
              the global healthcare documentation industry was still undecided
              about quality measurement parameters, we evolved our own quality
              standards based on the Association for Healthcare Documentation
              Integrity (AHDI) guidelines and offered our clients quality audits
              on several of our processes. The same data is analyzed and used to
              improve internal mechanisms and assure quicker and better service
              to all clients.
